# _Why_ Use `Tap`?

In _most_ situations **`Tape`** will be _exactly_ what you need
to write and run your Node.js/JavaScript tests.
**`Tape`** is minimalist, fast and has flexibility when you need it.
_Occasionally_ however, the needs of the project
require a few extra features from the testing framework.


## Analogy: _Single_ Speed vs. _Geared_ Bicycle

**`Tape`** is like a **single speed** bicycle;
lightweight, fewer "moving parts", less to learn and _fast_! <br />
_Perfect_ for **_short_ trips** on _relatively_ **_flat_ terrain**.
_Most_ journeys in cities fit this description.
_Most_ of the time you won't _need_ anything more than this
for commuting from home to work, going to the shops, etc.

**`Tap`** is the bicycle _with **gears**_ that allows you to tackle _mountains_.


> <small> **Note**: This analogy falls down if your commuting distance is far;
you need a geared bicycle for the long stretches!
Also, if you _never_ ride a bicycle - for whatever reason -
and don't appreciate the difference between
single speed and geared bikes this analogy might feel less relevant ...
in which case we recommend a bit of background reading:

# _Why_ NOT Use `Tap` _Everywhere_?


One of the _benefits_ of Free/Open Source software
is that there is near-zero "switching cost".
Since we aren't paying for the code, we can
